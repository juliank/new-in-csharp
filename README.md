## SharpLab

SharpLab is a .NET code playground that shows intermediate steps and results of code compilation. Some language features are thin wrappers on top of other features -- e.g. using() becomes try/finally. SharpLab allows you to see the code as compiler sees it, and get a better understanding of .NET languages.
